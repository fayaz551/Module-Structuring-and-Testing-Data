/*const twelveHourClockTime = "20:53";

// 
// The code above won't work because the variable names suggest that twelveHourClockTime should represent a time in 12-hour format, while twentyFourHourClockTime should represent a time in 24-hour format. However, the values assigned to these variables are not consistent with their names. To fix this error, we can either change the variable names to match the values or update the values to match the variable names. For example:

const twelveHourClockTime = "08:53 PM";
const twentyFourHourClockTime = "20:53";
