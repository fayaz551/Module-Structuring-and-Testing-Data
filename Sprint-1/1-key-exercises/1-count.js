let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// Line 3 is updating the value of the count variable. The = operator is an assignment operator, which assigns the value on the right (count + 1) to the variable on the left (count). In this case, it takes the current value of count (which is 0), adds 1 to it, and then assigns the result (1) back to count. So after this line executes, count will have a new value of 1.
